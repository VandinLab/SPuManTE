# FPGrowth Implementation

Code for the C++ implementation of the FPGrowth algorithm and variants of it for
maximal and closed itemesets.

The original code is described in the paper:

GoÌˆsta Grahne and Jianfei Zhu. Efficiently using prefix-trees in mining frequent
itemsets. In Bart Goethals and Mohammed Javeed Zaki, editors, FIMI, volume 90 of
CEUR Workshop Proc. CEUR-WS.org, 2003.

The code came to me (as far as I remember) without a LICENSE file. Many but not
all the source files contained the same BSD 3-clauses license so I copied it to
the LICENSE file in this directory.
